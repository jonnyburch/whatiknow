## Mission

 _'Survivorship Bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways.' â€“ Wikipedia_

A journey through a career is long and winding. Learning how to design and build great products is no exception. It takes time, and there's no template.

Learning about how to manage a team or build a design system doesn't actually help if you're a designer still struggling to find out what you love to do.

Creating and pushing personal projects which go viral is all well and good, but if you don't feel confident in your own voice, it feels very far away.

Finding out how a team of 100 at Facebook solved a problem when you are three people with no money may push you focus on the wrong things.

The right to tell the stories of how to find success and satisfaction in your work shouldn't exclusively belong to those with big networks and glittering careers. It shouldn't belong only to people who are comfortable putting themselves out there.

These voices introduce noise.

How do you cut through and find the advice that helps, the story that hits home? Someone with a strange journey, a hard battle, a new take?

 **Ask for it.**

Welcome to What I Know, a podcast which focuses on the types of people we need to hear more from. People still working it out, getting it wrong, fighting to find what they love to do and how to do it well.

### How does it work?

We will allow anyone, in under 15 minutes, to tell their story. You can nominate yourself or another to tell a story, on the phone, to one of us. The people we talk to will be chosen based on:

- Your journey to get to where you are (it doesn't have to be crazy or exciting, but it does have to be in some way actionable)
- Your candidness about what you've learnt along the way
- Your advice (or 'what I know') to help someone else.

The stories we choose will be published in our 'What I Know' podcast, or transcribed onto our blog.

 _We want our podcast to represent the people that are interested in its content, in their entirity. That means we want you to be able to bring your whole self to your story. Your race, gender, sexuality, religion, or any other part of what makes you you, will not incur any judgement. All you need is a story and the openness to tell it._
